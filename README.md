# Grafana Setup with Docker

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Honestly, you just need docker to setup monitoring with grafana. It's not that hard actually but im still exploring grafana tho.

1. Just spin up the containers with below command and everything is already setup for you!

```zsh
docker compose up -d
```
